# B-Trees Visualization, Manipulation, and Practice Tool

This is a tool that allows you to create customized B-Trees, manipulate them with a highly interactive user experience mode 
and generate random questions on them to practice their operations. There are several secondary features to improve the user experience further.  
Find the tool live [here](https://kaglet.github.io/B-Trees-Tool/).

## Features

## Main features

* Custom Tree Creation page to create a custom tree and random tree based off degree and/or number of nodes.
* Highly intuitive tree interaction and manipulation options using the drag and drop "snapping" mode allowing users to intuitively merge and un-merge keys into nodes by dragging them around and dropping.
* Insert/Delete keys to/from tree with input options for building a custom tree from scratch or editing a random tree.
* Perform insert/delete questions through dragging keys to a bin to delete them or inserting floating keys via snapping.
* Mark and validate trees after performing an insert/delete operation for a question.
* Endless question generation mode for practice of random delete/insert questions on a random tree. 
* Export tree to text file representation and import tree from text file representation.
* Canvas controls to pan tree and center tree.

## Supporting features

* With press of space-bar toggle between node drag mode and key drag mode.
* Click reset icon to reset to original tree after heavy modification of trees during question taking or random tree creation.
* Can show correct solution on incorrect answer if stuck. 
* Seeds that can be used to generate the same random tree every single time if given the same tree parameters.
* Validation of user input with appropriate error messages.
* Comprehensive user guide covering B-Tree theory, manipulation, insertion/deletion by cases, glossary, FAQ, and video walkthroughs.
* Clean, uncluttered, easy to use interface.

## Extra features

* Per page dark mode for the main pages.
* Quick help guide on custom tree creation page.

## Advanced features to potentially add in future

* Selective random generation. Generate insert/delete questions by specified cases beyond purely random generation.
* B-Tree Search question practice in addition to insert/delete.
* Setting up a series of questions on a created tree that could then be saveable and loadable with the tree.
* Advanced auto-marking mark allocation to marked questions based off complexity of operation.
