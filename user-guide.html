            <p>Left-clicking and dragging moves individual keys, however, there may be situations where we would like to move an entire node instead of just moving individual keys.</p>
            <p>To move an entire node, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Press the spacebar to enter “move entire node” mode.</li>
                <li>You will be able to determine if you are within this mode if all of the first keys within every node, including free nodes, are colored green.</li>
                <li>Select the first key within the node that you would like to move, by left-clicking the first key within the node and holding down the left mouse button.</li>
                <li>Note that the only key that you can select to move an entire node is the first key within the node, and this is indicated by the green color of the first key.</li>

            <h3>1.6) Establishing a Child Node Link:</h3>
            <p>To create a link between a child node and the tree, follow these detailed steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the node to which you want to attach a child node.</li>
                <li>Determine the keys between which you intend to establish a connection. The connection's nature is influenced by its placement in relation to these keys.</li>
                <li>Hover your mouse over the lower right or lower left corner of the key from which you wish to initiate the connection.</li>
                <li>When positioned correctly, a small red circle will appear, signaling that you can initiate a connection from this point.</li>
                <li>Left-click and hold down the mouse button to initiate the connection when you see the small red circle.</li>
                <li>Drag your mouse in the direction of the node you want to connect as a child to the tree.</li>
                <li>While dragging, you'll notice a yellow arrow extending from the original key location where you clicked; this arrow represents the ongoing connection process, often referred to as "connection mode."</li>
                <li>Additionally, during connection mode, a small red circle will appear at the middle-top of every node that can potentially serve as a child to the original node where you initiated the connection.</li>
                <li>To finalize the connection, while in connection mode, drag your mouse to the small red circle positioned at the top of the node you want to connect to.</li>
                <li>Upon hovering over the small red circle, release your mouse click to establish the connection.</li>
                <li>If the connection is successful, a yellow arrow will be drawn between the two nodes.</li>

        <section class="inner-section">
            <h3>1.7) Overwriting a Child Node:</h3>
            <p>There may be cases where a connection between a parent node and child node already exists, however, you would like to overwrite this already established connection to make a new connection between the parent node and a new child node.</p>
            <p>To overwrite a child node, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the parent node with the existing child node connection you want to replace.</li>
                <li>Determine the keys between which you intend to create the new connection, taking into account the adjusted relationship.</li>
                <li>Hover your mouse over the bottom right or bottom left corner of the key from which you wish to initiate the new connection.</li>
                <li>Once correctly positioned, a small red circle will indicate that you can initiate the connection from this location.</li>
                <li>Left-click and hold down the mouse button when the small red circle is visible to start the new connection.</li>
                <li>Drag your mouse towards the desired node you wish to connect as the new child node.</li>
                <li>During this process, you'll observe a yellow arrow extending from the original key location where you initiated the connection, representing the ongoing "connection mode."</li>
                <li>Additionally, within connection mode, a small red circle will appear at the middle-top of every node that can potentially become the new child node.</li>
                <li>To complete the process, while in connection mode, guide your mouse to the small red circle positioned at the top of the node you want to connect as the new child node.</li>
                <li>Upon hovering over the small red circle, release your mouse click to establish the new connection.</li>
                <li>If successful, a yellow arrow will be drawn between the parent node and the new child node, effectively overwriting the previous connection.</li>

        <section class="inner-section">
            <h3>1.8) Splitting the Root Node:</h3>
            <p>There may be cases where you need to split the root node of the tree so that the median key of the original root becomes the single key of the new root and the keys contained in the left half of the original root become the new roots’ left child and the keys contained in the right half of the original root become the new roots’ right node.</p>
            <p>Please note that functionality of splitting the node will only be available to the user if the root node has the maximum amount of keys i.e., (2t-1) keys.</p>
            <p>To split the root node, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Hover your mouse to the area slightly above the median key of the root node.</li>
                <li>If the root is available to be split then a split node symbol will appear. The symbol looks like a diverging path of three yellow arrows.</li>
                <li>Left click the mouse button to perform the split root function.</li>

            <p>To move an entire node, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Press the spacebar to enter “move entire node” mode.</li>
                <li>You will be able to determine if you are within this mode if all of the first keys within every node, including free nodes, are colored green.</li>
                <li>Select the first key within the node that you would like to move, by left-clicking the first key within the node and holding down the left mouse button.</li>
                <li>Note that the only key that you can select to move an entire node is the first key within the node, and this is indicated by the green color of the first key.</li>
                <li>While keeping the left mouse button pressed, drag your mouse to the desired location on the canvas.</li>
                <li>Once you've reached the desired position for the node on the canvas, release the left mouse button to place it.</li>

            <h3>1.6) Establishing a Child Node Link:</h3>
            <p>To create a link between a child node and the tree, follow these detailed steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the node to which you want to attach a child node.</li>
                <li>Determine the keys between which you intend to establish a connection. The connection's nature is influenced by its placement in relation to these keys.</li>
                <li>Hover your mouse over the lower right or lower left corner of the key from which you wish to initiate the connection.</li>
                <li>When positioned correctly, a small red circle will appear, signaling that you can initiate a connection from this point.</li>
                <li>Left-click and hold down the mouse button to initiate the connection when you see the small red circle.</li>
                <li>Drag your mouse in the direction of the node you want to connect as a child to the tree.</li>
                <li>While dragging, you'll notice a yellow arrow extending from the original key location where you clicked; this arrow represents the ongoing connection process, often referred to as "connection mode."</li>
                <li>Additionally, during connection mode, a small red circle will appear at the middle-top of every node that can potentially serve as a child to the original node where you initiated the connection.</li>
                <li>To finalize the connection, while in connection mode, drag your mouse to the small red circle positioned at the top of the node you want to connect to.</li>
                <li>Upon hovering over the small red circle, release your mouse click to establish the connection.</li>
                <li>If the connection is successful, a yellow arrow will be drawn between the two nodes.</li>

            <h3>1.7) Overwriting a Child Node:</h3>
            <p>There may be cases where a connection between a parent node and child node already exists, however, you would like to overwrite this already established connection to make a new connection between the parent node and a new child node.</p>
            <p>To overwrite a child node, follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Identify the parent node with the existing child node connection you want to replace.</li>
                <li>Determine the keys between which you intend to create the new connection, taking into account the adjusted relationship.</li>
                <li>Hover your mouse over the bottom right or bottom left corner of the key from which you wish to initiate the new connection.</li>
                <li>Once correctly positioned, a small red circle will indicate that you can initiate the connection from this location.</li>
                <li>Left-click and hold down the mouse button when the small red circle is visible to start the new connection.</li>
                <li>Drag your mouse towards the desired node you wish to connect as the new child node.</li>
                <li>During this process, you'll observe a yellow arrow extending from the original key location where you initiated the connection, representing the ongoing "connection mode."</li>
                <li>Additionally, within connection mode, a small red circle will appear at the middle-top of every node that can potentially become the new child node.</li>
                <li>To complete the process, while in connection mode, guide your mouse to the small red circle positioned at the top of the node you want to connect as the new child node.</li>
                <li>Upon hovering over the small red circle, release your mouse click to establish the new connection.</li>
                <li>If successful, a yellow arrow will be drawn between the parent node and the new child node, effectively overwriting the previous connection.</li>

            <h3>1.8) Splitting the Root Node:</h3>
            <p>There may be cases where you need to split the root node of the tree so that the median key of the original root becomes the single key of the new root and the keys contained in the left half of the original root become the new roots’ left child and the keys contained in the right half of the original root become the new roots’ right node.</p>
            <p>Please note that functionality of splitting the node will only be available to the user if the root node has the maximum amount of keys i.e., (2t-1) keys.</p>

                <p>Preemptive splitting is a type of insertion method that we use for inserting into B-trees. This method ensures that insertions within a B-Tree can be done within a single traversal to the insertion point.</p>
                <p>To preemptively split a B-Tree, while traversing the tree to the insertion point, we check every single node that we traverse to see if it needs to be preemptively split. This is done regardless of whether or not the insertion occurs at that node.</p>

                <p>To perform the split, take the median key of that node and place it into its parent node, then update the parent’s node child pointers to point to the left half of the split node and the right half of the split node in the appropriate locations.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Start at the Root Node: Begin the insertion process at the root node of the B-tree.</li>
                <li>Set the root node to be the node that we are currently inspecting. Let’s call this “Current Node”.</li>
                <li>Check the Current Node for preemptive splitting:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the current node has within it a number of keys that are equal to (2*t-1), then split the node.</li>
                    <li>This is done by taking the median of the current node and moving the median key to the appropriate position within the parent node of the current node. If the current node is the root node, perform splitting by making the median key of the root node the new root node.</li>
                    <li>Update the connections within the relationship between the parent node and current node to properly represent the correct child relationships.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>If the node is not full (has fewer than 2*t-1 keys), insert the key directly.</li>
                    <li>If the node is full then split the leaf node by moving the median key of the leaf node to its parent node. Now insert the key into the newly created child nodes where appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Finished: Your B-tree is now updated with the new key, and it remains balanced.</li>
                <li>Case 1: Inserting a key into a leaf node where the leaf node has less than the maximum amount of keys ie. (2t-1) keys.
