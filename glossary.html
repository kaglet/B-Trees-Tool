                definition: 'When a full node is divided into two nodes due to an overflow condition, the median key is the key that separates the two resulting nodes. The median key is chosen to maintain the balanced property of the B-tree and is placed in the parent node to guide future searches. The median is the key found at the middle index of keys within that node.'
